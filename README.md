# Healthcare Data Preparation & Analytics using SAS

This project focuses on preparing and analyzing healthcare data related to diabetes indicators
to support reliable analytics and data-driven insights.

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical records for several hundred patients and includes health indicators
such as cholesterol, glucose levels, blood pressure, body measurements, and demographic attributes.

## Objectives
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Missing value analysis and data completeness checks
- Summary statistics and exploratory analysis
- Correlation and frequency analysis
- Basic visual exploration (histograms)

## Methods (SAS)
- PROC IMPORT, PROC CONTENTS, PROC PRINT
- Missing value analysis using CMISS
- PROC MEANS, PROC FREQ, PROC CORR
- PROC SGPLOT for visual exploration

## How to Run
1. Ensure the dataset is located at `data/diabetes_upd.csv`.
2. Run the SAS script: `sas/data_preprocessing.sas`.

## Tools
- SAS
- CSV dataset

## Outcome
The project produces a structured dataset and statistical insights that support healthcare analytics
and can be used for downstream modeling.
