Healthcare Data Preparation & Analytics using SAS
Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end healthcare data preparation and exploratory analytics using SAS, focusing on diabetes-related health indicators.
The goal is to improve data quality, ensure analytical readiness, and generate reliable insights that support data-driven decision-making in healthcare analytics environments.

Dataset

The dataset consists of medical records for several hundred patients and includes structured healthcare indicators such as:

Cholesterol levels

Glucose measurements

Blood pressure

Body measurements (e.g., BMI-related attributes)

Demographic features

The data represents a realistic healthcare analytics scenario where data quality and consistency are critical.

Key Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw healthcare data for analytical use.

Assess missing values and data completeness across medical indicators.

Perform exploratory statistical analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.

Prepare a structured dataset suitable for reporting and downstream modeling.
